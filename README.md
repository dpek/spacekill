Spacekill
=========
Spacekill is a game by Darwin Pek about killing people in space. And
also about running away from said people in space.

This repository is a mostly unaltered verson of the game I wrote at the
EGaDS (Electronic Game Developers Society) Game Jam in under 24 hours,
with a few renamed assets and a couple of comments here and there.

This game will not run by itself. For more information, please see the
section labeled "Third Party Tools".

Third Party Tools
=================
Spacekill uses a proprietary third party plugin called tk2d. This
Unity plugin can be obtained at the official tk2d site
(http://www.unikronsoftware.com/2dtoolkit/) and is not included in this
repository.
