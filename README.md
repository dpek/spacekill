Spacekill
=========
Spacekill is a game by Darwin Pek about killing people in space. And
also about running away from said people in space.

This repository is a mostly unaltered verson of the game I wrote at the
EGaDS (Electronic Game Developers Society) Game Jam 2013 in under 24
hours, with a few renamed assets and a couple of comments here and
there.

This game will not run by itself. For more information, please see the
section labeled "Third Party Tools".

Third Party Tools
-----------------
Spacekill uses a proprietary third party plugin called tk2d. This
Unity plugin can be obtained at the official tk2d site
(http://www.unikronsoftware.com/2dtoolkit/) and is not included in this
repository.

To build the game, you will need to import version 2.20 final + hotfix
0 of tk2d into the Unity Project.
